In this assignment, we will perform various tasks involving principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression, and dimensionality reduction.

We will need the following packages:


```{R, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
packages <- c(
  "tibble",
  "dplyr", 
  "readr", 
  "tidyr", 
  "purrr", 
  "broom",
  "magrittr",
  "corrplot",
  "car"
)
# renv::install(packages)
sapply(packages, require, character.only=T)
```

## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 70 points
Principal component anlaysis and variable selection
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)


The `data` folder contains a `spending.csv` dataset which is an illustrative sample of monthly spending data for a group of $5000$ people across a variety of categories. The response variable, `income`, is their monthly income, and objective is to predict the `income` for a an individual based on their spending patterns.

Read the data file as a tibble in R. Preprocess the data such that:

1. the variables are of the right data type, e.g., categorical variables are encoded as factors
2. all column names to lower case for consistency
3. Any observations with missing values are dropped

```{R}
path <- "data/spending.csv"

df <- read_csv(path)
```
```{R}

df <- df %>% as_tibble() %>% drop_na()



```

---

###### 1.2 (5 points)

Visualize the correlation between the variables using the `corrplot()` function. What do you observe? What does this mean for the model?

```{R}
# df_x  %>% ... # Insert your code here

corrplot(cor(df))
```
I observe that most of the variables have some degree of positive correlation with each other.  This means that the model generally favors a positive correlation between variables.
---

###### 1.3 (5 points)

Run a linear regression model to predict the `income` variable using the remaining predictors. Interpret the coefficients and summarize your results. 


```{R}
linreg <- lm(income ~ ., data = df)

summary(linreg)
```
As spending on video games increases by 1, the income of the individual goes up by 0.86.  As spending on vegetables increases by 1, the income of the individual goes down by -0.06.  From this model, it can be observed that only a few variables are predicted to negatively correlate with income, namely vegetables, food_delivery, and alcohol.
---

###### 1.3 (5 points)

Diagnose the model using the `vif()` function. What do you observe? What does this mean for the model?

```{R}

vif(linreg)


```
I observe that some variables have significantly larger values such as restaurant_meals, smartphones, video games, and electronics.  This suggest that there may he a high degree of multicollinearity present in the model.
---

###### 1.4 (5 points)

Perform PCA using the `princomp` function in R. Print the summary of the PCA object.

```{R}
pca <- princomp(~., data = df)


summary(pca)


```

---

###### 1.5 (5 points)

Make a screeplot of the proportion of variance explained by each principal component. How many principal components would you choose to keep? Why?

```{R}

screeplot(pca)



```
??????????????????

###### 1.6 (5 points)

By setting any factor loadings below $0.2$ to $0$, summarize the factor loadings for the principal components that you chose to keep. 

```{R}
clean_loadings <- loadings(pca, digits = 3, cutoff = 0.2, sort = FALSE)


summary(clean_loadings)
```


Visualize the factor loadings. 

```{R}
plot(clean_loadings, type = "screeplot")
```

---

###### 1.7 (15 points)

Based on the factor loadings, what do you think the principal components represent? 

Provide an interpreation for each principal component you chose to keep.

---

###### 1.8 (10 points)

Create a new data frame with the original response variable `income` and the principal components you chose to keep. Call this data frame `df_pca`.

```R
... # Insert your code here
```

Fit a regression model to predict the `income` variable using the principal components you chose to keep. Interpret the coefficients and summarize your results. 

```R
... # Insert your code here
```

Compare the results of the regression model in 1.3 and 1.9. What do you observe? What does this mean for the model?

```R
... # Insert your code here

```
---

###### 1.10 (10 points)

Based on your interpretation of the principal components from Question 1.7, provide an interpretation of the regression model in Question 1.9.
